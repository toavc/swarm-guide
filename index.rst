SWARM Guide
*************
Swarm is a social network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to interact with each other using smart contracts, and it provides an interface to access decentralized applications (dApps) running on the Ethereum mainnet.

While building Swarm, we learned many things about how dApp developers would like their apps to be integrated into a social network. We also decided that our design was not optimal for end-users who are looking for a more traditional experience in terms of user interaction and application discovery. Therefore, we have decided to start over from scratch! The new client is called Bee!

We designed Bee with you in mind! You can now enjoy all features you got used to when using Facebook or Twitter while interacting with your favorite dApps at the same time without ever leaving the app!
